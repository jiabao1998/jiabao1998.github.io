    "text": "Starting with constructing a formal definition/classification system for recursion and consequently dividing recursive sequences into different levels and subtypes, the current paper presents an experimental study of Mandarin-speaking children’s acquisition of three subtypes of 2-level recursive sequences exemplified with the so-called “recursive relative clauses (RCs)”, reanalyzed as the 2-level tail-, nested-, and mixed-recursion RC sequences. 249 Mandarin-speaking children aged 4–9 years and 46 adult controls are recruited to finish a most-structured elicited Production task. The main findings are as follows: in general, children have acquired 1-level recursive RC sequences by the age of 4, but they have not acquired 2-level tail-recursion RC sequences until the age of 6, they have not acquired 2-level mixed-recursion RC sequences until the age of 8–9, and they have not acquired 2-level nested-recursion RC sequences until the age of at least 10; before acquiring 2-level recursive RC sequences, children tend to replace them with 1-level recursive RC sequences or coordinate structures. This experimental study provides new data and accounts for the development of the faculty of linguistic recursion, and also evidence in support of the formal definition/classification system for recursion.

    "text": "Many studies have substantiated the perceptual symbol system, which assumes a routine generation of perceptual information during language comprehension, but little is known about the processing format in which the perceptual information of different dimensions is conveyed simultaneously during sentence comprehension. The current study provides the first experimental evidence of how multidimensional perceptual information (color and shape) was processed during online sentence comprehension in Mandarin. We designed three consecutive sentence–picture verification tasks that only differed in the delay of the display of pictures preceded by declarative sentences. The processing was analyzed in three stages based on time intervals (i.e., 0ms, +750ms, +1500ms). The response accuracy and response time data were reported. The initial stage (i.e., ISI=0ms) attested the match effect of color and shape, but the simulated representation of color and shape did not interact. In the intermediate stage (i.e., ISI=750ms), the routinely simulated color and shape interacted, but the match facilitation was found only in cases where one perceptual information was in mismatch while the other was not. In the final stage (i.e., ISI=1500ms), the match facilitation of one particular perceptual property was influenced by a mismatch with the other perceptual property. These results suggested that multiple perceptual information presented simultaneously was processed in an additive manner to a large extent before entering into the final stage, where the simulated perceptual information was integrated in a multiplicative manner. The results also suggested that color and shape were comparable to object recognition when conjointly conveyed. In relation to other evidence from behavioral and event-related potential studies on sentence reading in the discussion, we subscribed to the idea that the full semantic integration became available over time.\n@article{bai2022semantic,\n  title = {Semantic integration of multidimensional perceptual information in L1 sentence comprehension},\n  author = {Bai, Bing and Yang, Caimei and Fan, Jiabao},\n  journal = {Language and Cognition},\n  volume = 14,\n  number = 1,\n  pages = {109--130},\n  year = 2022,\n  publisher = {Cambridge University Press}\n}"
