## Semantic integration of multidimensional perceptual information in L1 sentence comprehension

Many studies have substantiated the perceptual symbol system, which assumes a routine
generation of perceptual information during language comprehension, but little is known
about the processing format in which the perceptual information of different dimensions is
conveyed simultaneously during sentence comprehension. The current study provides the first
experimental evidence of how multidimensional perceptual information (color and shape) was
processed during online sentence comprehension in Mandarin. We designed three consecutive
sentenceâ€“picture verification tasks that only differed in the delay of the display of
pictures preceded by declarative sentences. The processing was analyzed in three stages
based on time intervals (i.e., 0ms, +750ms, +1500ms). The response accuracy and response
time data were reported. The initial stage (i.e., ISI=0ms) attested the match effect of
color and shape, but the simulated representation of color and shape did not interact. In
the intermediate stage (i.e., ISI=750ms), the routinely simulated color and shape
interacted, but the match facilitation was found only in cases where one perceptual
information was in mismatch while the other was not. In the final stage (i.e., ISI=1500ms),
the match facilitation of one particular perceptual property was influenced by a mismatch
with the other perceptual property. These results suggested that multiple perceptual
information presented simultaneously was processed in an additive manner to a large extent
before entering into the final stage, where the simulated perceptual information was
integrated in a multiplicative manner. The results also suggested that color and shape
were comparable to object recognition when conjointly conveyed. In relation to other
evidence from behavioral and event-related potential studies on sentence reading in the
discussion, we subscribed to the idea that the full semantic integration became available
over time.
